## Usage

Currently, usage is academic. However, you can test the form validation functionality by entering/not entering data in the fields.  You will see an error message and border around fields with invalid entries.  To clear the error, enter valid data and click the submit button again.  

After successful validation, you'll be directed to the 'Providers' page.
